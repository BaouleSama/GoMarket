# GoMarket

GoMarket is an online grocery delivery platform tailored for African stores, allowing customers to browse, search for products, add items to their cart, and complete checkout seamlessly. The platform aims to connect African markets with customers and delivery services, similar to Instacart but specifically for African groceries.
